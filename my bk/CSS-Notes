1. How CSS Selectors Work
		#ID selector : ID selectors are the most powerful. but that's typically considered bad, because it's nice to have lower-specificity selectors that are easier to override when needed.
		#Class selector
		#Tag selector
		#Attribute Selector
	
	We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

		Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
		Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
		Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
		Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
		Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
		
		
		Syntax
			[attr]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr.
			[attr=value]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is exactly value.
			[attr~=value]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly value.
			[attr|=value]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value can be exactly value or can begin with value immediately followed by a hyphen, - (U+002D). It is often used for language subcode matches.
			[attr^=value]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is prefixed (preceded) by value.
			[attr$=value]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is suffixed (followed) by value.
			[attr*=value]
			Represents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value contains at least one occurrence of value within the string.
			[attr operator value i]
			Adding an i (or I) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).
			[attr operator value s] 
			Adding an s (or S) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-sensitively (for characters within the ASCII range).

		^= : beginning with
		*= : anywhere
		[href*="insensitive" i] : anywhere in the URL,   regardless of capitalization
		[href*="cAsE" s] : anywhere in the URL,   with matching capitalization
		$= : that end
		
2. CSS Specificity
		1	If the element has inline styling, that automatically1 wins (1,0,0,0 points)
		2	For each ID value, apply 0,1,0,0 points
		3	For each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), apply 0,0,1,0 points
		4	For each element reference, apply 0,0,0,1 point

3. CSS Combinators
	There are four different combinators in CSS:
		1	descendant selector (space)
		2	child selector (>) : it will select only children 
		3	adjacent sibling selector (+) : it selects all elements that are placed immediately after specified element
		4	general sibling selector (~) : The general sibling selector selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.


4. Pseudo-class selectors 
	A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
		For example, it can be used to:
			Style an element when a user mouses over it
			Style visited and unvisited links differently(LVHA)
			Style an element when it gets focus
